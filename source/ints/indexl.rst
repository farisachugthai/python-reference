long
====
These represent numbers in an unlimited range, subject to available (virtual) memory only. For the purpose of shift and mask operations, a binary representation is assumed, and negative numbers are represented in a variant of 2â€™s complement which gives the illusion of an infinite string of sign bits extending to the left.

Constructors
====
`long()`_
    Returns an expression converted into a long integer number.
`literal syntax`_
    Initializes a new instance of the **long** type.
    
Base Designators
====
`0... (Base Designators)`_
    Returns a decimal integer converted from the specified base.
    
Methods
====
`bit_length`_
    Returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros.
