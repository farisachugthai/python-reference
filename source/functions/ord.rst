Remarks
=======
This function is the inverse of chr() for 8-bit strings and of unichr() for unicode objects. If a unicode argument is given and Python was built with UCS2 Unicode, then the characterâ€™s code point must be in the range [0..65535] inclusive; otherwise the string length is two, and a TypeError will be raised.

Example 1
=========
>>> ord('a')
97
>>> ord('A')
65

Example 2
=========
>>> ord(u'a')
97
>>> ord(u'\u2020')
8224
