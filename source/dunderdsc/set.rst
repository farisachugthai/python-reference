*instance*
    Required. Instance is the instance that the attribute was accessed through, or None when the attribute is accessed through the owner.
*value*
    Required. The value we want to assign to the attribute.

Example
====
::

    # this is our descriptor object
    class Bar(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self.value = ''
        def __get__(self, instance, owner):
            print "returned from descriptor object"
            return self.value
        def __set__(self, instance, value):
            print "set in descriptor object"
            self.value = value
        def __delete__(self, instance):
            print "deleted in descriptor object"
            del self.value

    class Foo(object):
        bar = Bar()

    f = Foo()
    f.bar = 10
    print f.bar
    del f.bar

    set in descriptor object
    returned from descriptor object
    10
